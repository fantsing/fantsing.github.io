[{"content":"Transformer is a typical Seq2Seq model. Attention mechanism: Selectively focus on the important parts and ignore the unimportant ones. Embedding: The process of mapping textual information into numerical information. Queries (query vectors), Keys (key vectors), Values (value vectors) Step 1 is to create three new vectors q, k, and v for each input vector of the encoder. Step 2 is to calculate a correlation score (Score) $$ Score\\_{1.1}=\\\\mathbf{q}\\_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{k}*1=|q\\_1||k\\_1|\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ Score*{1.2}=\\\\mathbf{q}\\_1 \\\\cdot \\\\mathbf{k}\\_2=|q\\_1||k\\_2|\\\\cos\\\\theta\\\\ ... $$ Step 3 is to divide the correlation score (Score) by 8, which will make the gradient during the model training more stable. Step 4 involves obtaining the weight factors through Softmax. Step 5 is to multiply each value vector by the corresponding Softmax score. $$ \\\\text{Attention}(Q, K, V) = \\\\text{Softmax}\\\\left( \\\\frac{QK^{\\\\mathrm{T}}}{\\\\sqrt{d\\_k}} \\\\right) V $$ Multi-heads self-attention mechanism Encoder-decoder, initially developed to solve the problem of text translation Cross-attention mechanism\n","date":"2025-10-15T13:52:23+08:00","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/p/transformer/","title":"Transformer"},{"content":"Mathematical notation in a Hugo project can be enabled by using third party JavaScript libraries.\nIn this example we will be using KaTeX\nCreate a partial under /layouts/partials/math.html Within this partial reference the Auto-render Extension or host these scripts locally.
